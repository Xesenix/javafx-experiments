Simple editor for bazier curve path.

Tasks:

- Appearance:
	- [ ] styling undecorated window
	- [ ] animated console messages for all actions [turn it in some kind of component]
	- [ ] focusing edited element highlights it 

- Patterns:

- Futures:
	- [x] drawing bazier curve between path points with use of in/out vectors on each path point
	- [x] movable path points
	- [x] movable path points in/out vector handles
	- [x] binding listview cells to existing path list
	- [x] binding listview cells to existing path points list
	- [ ] selecting paths listview item selects path for editing
